# music_recommender_system_py
The program asks you to select 3 users, by id (from 0 to 2033) and it will show the recommended artists for the users you selected. 
The original dataset file can be found [here](http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~ocelma/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-360K.html), 
but I took only the 100k first lines because the original file is 1.67GB large.

#To run the program
python music_recommender.py
